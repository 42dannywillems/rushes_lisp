# LISP rush

Functional paradigm is a very interesting one. In 42, we learn OCaml within a
[pool](https://github.com/42dannywillems/Piscine.OCaml.git).
We also learn elisp during the [Mexican
Standoff](https://github.com/42dannywillems/rushes_mexican.standoff.git) rush.

Now, it's time to learn LISP. To learn it, we need to implement a version of a
conway automaton.
